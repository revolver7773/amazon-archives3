An open specification for streaming massive heterogeneous 3D geospatial datasets.

[3D Tiles v1.0](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/releases/tag/1.0) has entered the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [Community Standard](https://cesium.com/blog/2016/09/06/3d-tiles-and-the-ogc/) process.

## Overview

3D Tiles defines a spatial data structure and a set of tile formats designed for streaming and rendering 3D geospatial content such as Photogrammetry, 3D Buildings, BIM/CAD, Instanced Features, and Point Clouds.

## Specification

* [3D Tiles Format Specification](./specification/)
* [3D Tiles Extension Registry](./extensions/)

## Future Work

Additional tile formats are under development, including Vector Data (`vctr`) [[#124](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/tree/3d-tiles-next/TileFormats/VectorData)] for geospatial features like points, lines, and polygons.

See the full roadmap issue for plans post version 1.0 [[#309](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/issues/309)], as well as issues marked as **3D Tiles [Next](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anext)**.

## Contributing

3D Tiles is an open specification and contributions including specification fixes, new tile formats, and extensions are encouraged. See our guidelines for contributing in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
